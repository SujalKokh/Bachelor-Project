Q4. 
Answer
I would go with Agile development strategy. Under Agile development I would choose SCRUM as the changing requirement can be addressed easily.

1. Requirement
First the requirement for the website/mobile application will be found by listening to the business context.
Different sprints will be created according to the needs and requirement for the application. After defining the sprints
the client will be asked to assign the value for the sprints.

2. Analysis
The time for all the sprints are checked and noted. Every sprints are defined under the time period of 30 days at maximum. Any
kind of sprint which takes more than 30 days are broken down into smaller sprints. The cost, time and requirement for each sprint are developed.

3. Design
The sprints are coded according to the priority set by the client. During the design phase, if there are modules that can be reused, 
the decision can be done using decision tree.

4. Evolution
Any changes in current sprints development will be done in this phase.

5. Devlivary
The developed module will be delivered to the client for use. The backlog will be view for designing next sprint.
